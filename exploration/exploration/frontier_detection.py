frontier_detection.py

Pure frontier-detection logic with no ROS dependencies, so it can be shared by
both the frontier_detector debug node and the frontier_explorer node. Single
source of truth — no copy-pasted detection loop that can drift out of sync.

A frontier cell is a FREE cell with at least one UNKNOWN 4-neighbour: it sits on
the boundary between mapped and unmapped space.
