"""
waypoint_finder.py

Turns raw frontier cells into a small list of candidate waypoints.

Pipeline inside find_waypoints():
    frontier cells
        -> size-capped BFS clustering          (group connected frontier into bites)
        -> drop clusters that are too small     (noise rejection)
        -> centroid of each cluster, snapped to a real frontier cell (the waypoint)
        -> estimate info gain around each waypoint (unknown cells in the sensor disk)
        -> convert the waypoint cell to world (map-frame) coordinates
    -> list[Waypoint]

The class holds no ROS state; it is pure logic so it is easy to unit test.
The owning node passes in the latest /map data every cycle.
